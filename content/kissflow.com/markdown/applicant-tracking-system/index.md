Employees are an organization's backbone, so finding the right talent is critical. Sourcing potential candidates and onboarding them as employees are important stages of talent acquisition. Tracking and sifting through thousands of applications for a single job can be daunting for talent managers. The Applicant Tracking System (ATS) app assists recruiters in identifying qualified candidates and onboarding them as employees. Talent managers can use the ATS app to commence hiring through the careers site, by directly adding resumes to the applicant talent pool, and through employee referrals. The app includes a dashboard layout that displays data at your fingertips. Recruiters and candidates can benefit from an improved and faster recruitment process with the ATS app, which automates candidate sourcing.
