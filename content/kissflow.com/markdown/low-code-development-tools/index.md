#  8 Best Low-Code Tools for App Development of 2025 
Team Kissflow
Updated on 21 Nov 2024 •  10 min read
Are you looking for the **best low-code tools** for app development ? You aren’t alone. A study by Gartner says, [70 percent of new business applications](https://kissflow.com/low-code/low-code-development-tools/<https:/www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences>) will be built with low-code/no-code technologies by 2025. Adopting a [low-code platform](https://kissflow.com/low-code/low-code-development-tools/</kissflow.com/low-code>) is a big decision. If you choose the wrong platform, you could spend months or years suffering through difficulties, only to switch to an entirely different option later. The platform you choose should match your strategy perfectly so that your development plans can grow alongside the platform. With so many tools in the market, it can be hard to choose the right low-code platform that will best fit your enterprise’s needs. We’ve curated a list of the top low-code development tools based on their features, capabilities, customer preferences, and pros and cons. We’ve also tried to align the tools with the right strategy to help your decision. Of course, we are partial to Kissflow, but we also know Kissflow isn’t the best low-code development tool for every strategy. Read through the options and pick the platform that serves your needs best.
## Kissflow
Kissflow is unique amongst low-code development tools because it is primarily built for non-programmers to create their own solutions. Yet, it also has lots of options for developers to use [low-code tools to make complex enterprise applications.](https://kissflow.com/low-code/low-code-development-tools/<https:/kissflow.com/low-code>) When compared to other platforms, Kissflow’s strengths are its no-code workflows, project boards, forms, and integrations. All of these modules are extremely intuitive and yet very powerful for practitioners to create applications and end-to-end processes.

Why Kissflow 
###### Kissflow is the ideal solution if your digital transformation strategy includes citizen development. If you want to expand the number of people capable of participating in development to include people like business analysts, process owners, power Excel users, and you also need a governable platform, there aren’t many true options. Kissflow’s simple and smart interface allows everyone to build on the platform, making it possible to scale your [application development](https://kissflow.com/low-code/low-code-development-tools/<https:/kissflow.com/application-development>) exponentially while still staying governed and safe.

###### In the Microsoft universe

###### "Microsoft Power Apps is lauded for its user-friendly approach to creating custom business applications. With a drag-and-drop interface, seamless data integration, and connections to other Microsoft tools, I can quickly develop powerful apps for my company. Its visual development approach, integration with other Microsoft tools like Power BI and Power Automate, and cross-device compatibility make it a great product."

Cons ![pros](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/anger.svg)
  * ![Icon](https://23692390.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23692390/cons.svg)
###### Separate apps for separate functions
Skilled users can create applications in Power Apps. But to create a workflow, they need to switch to Power Automate. This requires learning an entirely new system.
  * ![Icon](https://23692390.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23692390/cons.svg)
###### Limited outside of Microsoft tools
Power Apps has some connectors with non-Microsoft tools, but it does not integrate as easily. 


  * ![Icon](https://23692390.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23692390/cons.svg)
###### Expensive
Power Apps might seem to be a deal if it is bundled with other licenses, but you’ll need the full support of the Power Platform, including Dataverse to get any kind of value out of it. 
  * ![Icon](https://23692390.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23692390/cons.svg)
###### Training Intensive
Although the platform is meant for non-coders, every module requires extensive training, which slows down adoption.

###### "If we have more complex functionality with more logic embedded into the app, debugging can often be difficult. We have to use little hacks to debug the app which is time consuming. Another problem is that it is hard to work with the delegation errors. Making a simple filter using the "in" operator cuases problems sometimes, when this should be simple. Also, the data limitations of 2000 records makes it hard to work with this app. Often, our lists go up to 5000 records and we need to be able to pull in those records into the app in a gallery. Otherwise it results in loading issues."

## Appian
Appian helps organizations automate complex business processes. The low-code platform provides a unified design experience with SAIL, their patented low-code system. The platform’s no-code data management tool uses Data Fabric, which simplifies data access and enables self-service data consumption.**Check out:**[ Kissflow vs Appian: A Detailed Comparison](https://kissflow.com/low-code/low-code-development-tools/<https:/kissflow.com/compare/kissflow-vs-appian/>)

###### "While developing a simple application is really easy using Mendix, when the logic is more complex and the operations are more sophisticated, the process gets harder. Because of development speed every change in requirements is twice as painful. The platform is also not the best when it comes to performance - some operations are impossible to be developed optimally without usage of java code. Also mendix academy courses have errors which makes it hard to train newcomers in the technology."
