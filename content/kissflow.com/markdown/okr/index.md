  * Description
  * Modules & Features
  * How to Install


​Every organization has an objective that drives it. Often, these objectives and the metrics required are not clearly defined or communicated to the employees. This creates an understanding gap for the team or person executing it, which then results in different outcomes. With the OKR app, objectives can be set company-wide and for specific teams within a time frame. Strategic objectives and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for teams can be defined using this app. The OKR app is a digital tool that lets you give your team and the company a clear direction so that they can reach their desired goals.​
# **Setting objectives**
  * Add strategic goals for the company.
  * Sort, filter, modify, or delete goals based on your requirements.


# **Measure Key Performance Indicators**
  * Add KPIs to the form, and if needed, they can align it to a strategic goal.
  * KPI metrics can be measured in percentage, numerical value, and currencies such as dollars, rupees, and euros.


# **Team-wise objectives**
  * OKRs and KPIs can be set and viewed separately for specific teams.
  * The status of the OKRs can be tracked using cards, such as  _On track,__At risk,_ etc.
  * Align team-specific OKRs to a strategic goal, another OKR, or to improve a KPI.
  * Add new teams to the existing list with leads and members.


# ​
# **Individual objectives**
OKRs and KPIs assigned to you can be viewed here.
# Employees can assess the priority of the objectives and act based on them.
# **View reports**
  * Learn more about the status of the OKRs as a whole, the number of teams, etc., through charts.
  * Get a table of the OKR status for each team.
