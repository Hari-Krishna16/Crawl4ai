# Privacy Policy
06.12.2024
Kissflow Inc.,1000 N West Street, Suite 1200Wilmington, Delaware 19801
Kissflow is a product of Kissflow Inc.,
#### Information we collect:
For those users who provide requisite authorization during the account setup and login process, Kissflow collects information from enquiry forms, contacts forms, Google GSuite or Microsoft Office 365, and others, as applicable to provide better service to all users. This includes first name, last name, email address, phone numbers and email groups that users belong to. We store this personal information on Google Cloud Services. Our legal basis for the collection of user data is Art 6 (1) b) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to optimize our product, increase the user experience, improve our marketing, enhance our customer support, and build more efficient internal processes.
#### Information we collect as customers use our service
Kissflow may collect specific information about how customers use our product. This includes situations such as how a customer uses a specific feature and when a customer uses the product. The information is collected as data logs, images, or a logical sequence of images/videos to replay an issue encountered by a user. Our logging system automatically collects information such as the internet protocol address, browser type, browser language, referring URL, features accessed, errors generated, time zone, geo-location data, operating system information, and other such information that is transmitted in the header of the user’s HTTP request. This information is stored in log files. Kissflow uses these log files to analyze trends, administer, and improve the application. Our legal basis for the collection of user data is Art 6 (1) b) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to optimize our product, increase user experience, enhance our customer support, and improve our internal process efficiency.
#### Google user data
We use Google APIs to achieve the following:
  1. Google OAuth APIs are used to perform a Single Sign On through Google. While doing so we ensure that the email provided by the Google Auth server is a valid user of the Kissflow system.
  2. We use Google Drive APIs to retrieve the URLs and IDs of the files attached by the user to his/her Kissflow account. We also manage the permissions of these files through the drive APIs when the workflow on Kissflow attached to these files is in progress.


#### Cookies
We use cookies on all our websites and software applications. Cookies are small text files that your browser saves on your computer and mobile device, which allow an analysis of your usage. Cookies contain information about your device and your connection to the Internet, such as IP address, operating system, and browser used. We use our access to the information in the cookies to optimize our offering, present appropriate content to customers easily, and improve our advertising and marketing.
Most of the cookies we use are so-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted by your browser after the end of your visit to our website. Session cookies provide us with information about visitor behavior on our website, which we analyze. With the knowledge gained, we will make our website more user-friendly, place important content on the most popular pages, and develop our marketing strategies according to the interests of our target audience. Other cookies are stored longer on your device and allow us to recognize you as a user during a subsequent visit to our website.
We do not pass on information that we receive through our cookies to third parties. By using the “Incognito” or “Private” mode of your browser, or by means of adjusting the settings in your browser, you can prevent the installation of cookies. As a result, some of the facilitation of operating our website will no longer work. Nevertheless, you can use the website, log in, and explore all the offers of Kissflow.com, even without cookies. Our legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to optimize our product, increase user experience, enhance our customer support, and improve our internal process efficiency.
#### How we use the information we collect

When a customer contacts Kissflow, we may keep a record of customer communication to help solve any issues the customer might be facing.
If you contact us by email or contact form, the information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing the request and for possible follow-up questions.

#### International data transfer
We may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties (as provided herein) across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
#### How secure is your personal data and information with us?
We work hard to protect Kissflow and our users from unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:

  2. We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
  3. We restrict access to personal information to Kissflow employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.


We are also ISO 27001 Certified, and we follow all the regulatory norms set by this standard. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
#### Retention, deletion, or blocking of data
We adhere to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization. Therefore, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes mentioned here or as long as the many storage periods required by law. After discontinuation of the respective purpose or expiry of these deadlines, the corresponding data will be blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. Our legal basis for the deletion or blocking of personal data is Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR.
Your rights of access, rectification, cancellation, limitation of processing, data portability, and withdrawal of consent.We will provide access to your personal data stored by us at any time. If you wish, you will receive it in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. We will be happy to correct, edit, limit, or delete your personal data at your request, provided that no statutory storage requirements are in conflict, or forward them to another responsible office. If your personal data stored with us has been processed incorrectly, out-of-date, or unlawfully, you can restrict its processing by us. Finally, you may change or revoke your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time with future effect. To contact us for any of these concerns, please email us atprivacy@kissflow.com. Our legal basis for the disclosure, correction, deletion, limitation of processing and data transmission is the respective request of the data subject.
You have the right to complain about the improper processing of your personal data (such as collection, storage, modification, transfer, deletion, etc.) by emailing us atprivacy@kissflow.com.
#### Modification of this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure that it complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the Privacy Policy, such as when introducing new services. Your new visit will be subject to the new privacy policy.
