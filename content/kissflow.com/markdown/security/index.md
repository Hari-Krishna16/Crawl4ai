![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Vulnerability%20Management.svg)
####  Vulnerability Management
Kissflow has a well established Vulnerability management program that involves assessing the severity and impact of each vulnerability, prioritizing them based on risk, and implementing appropriate remediation measures to ensure the security and integrity of our systems.
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Datacenter%20Security.svg)
####  Datacenter Security
AWS and GCP employ world-class physical security measures in their data centers, including stringent access controls, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and 24/7 monitoring. These measures safeguard against unauthorized access, physical threats, and provide a secure hosting environment for our platform
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Secure%20Configuration%20Management.svg)
####  Secure Configuration Management
Our procedures ensure secure configuration of operating systems and applications, disabling default passwords and unnecessary features. We define and consistently apply security baselines, track system configuration changes, and align with industry best practices such as CIS.

## Data Security
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Encryption.svg)
####  Encryption
AES 256, the industry standard for encryption, is utilized to encrypt all data at rest on our platform. Similarly, when data is in transit either within our network or over the internet, it is encrypted using HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ to ensure secure transmission.
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Retention%20and%20Erasure%20of%20Data.svg)
####  Retention and Erasure of Data
Throughout the period of service usage, Kissflow will uphold the maintenance of customer data. However, upon termination of the services, all data will be permanently erased from the production environment within 30 days, and from the backup system within 90 days.
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Data%20portability.svg)

## Application Security
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Secure%20Software%20Development.svg)
####  Secure Software Development
We have a well-established change management cycle that ensures all code changes undergo a rigorous authorization, testing, and verification process before being deployed to the production environment. This ensures that only authorized and thoroughly validated code modifications are implemented.
![Card icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Code%20reviews.svg)
####  Code Reviews
We adhere to secure coding practices throughout the development process and employ stringent quality gating measures, including static code analysis, to ensure the highest level of code integrity.

Security incidents involving third-party vendors are promptly investigated and addressed. 
![Kissflow_Icon](https://kissflow.com/hubfs/Regulatory%20compliance.svg)
####  Regulatory Compliance
Regular audits are conducted to ensure ongoing compliance, and we have a process to address and rectify any non-compliance issues. Privacy and data protection regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, are considered, along with specific compliance requirements of our industry or market.
