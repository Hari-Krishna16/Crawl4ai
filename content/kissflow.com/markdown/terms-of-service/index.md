Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere, We shall not be liable for unavailability of the Services caused by circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, such as but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, acts of terror, or civil unrest, technical failures beyond Kissflow’s reasonable control (including, without limitation, inability to access the internet, unauthorized loss, distribution or dissemination of Your Data), or acts undertaken by third parties, including without limitation, distributed denial of service attacks on the Platform.13.5. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to, or connected with these Terms shall be resolved by mediation first, failing which they shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration in Delaware under the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA** ”) and rules thereunder. The arbitration proceedings shall be in English and conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall appoint an arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator in the panel. Judgments upon the final decisions rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware. Judgment on the award may be final and binding on the Parties.13.6. Notices and Consent to Electronic Communications. All notices to be provided by Kissflow to You under these Terms may be delivered in writing (i) by internationally/ nationally recognized delivery service or to the contact mailing address provided by You on any order form while subscribing to the Services; or (ii) electronic mail to the e-mail address provided for Your Account. Kissflow’s address for a notice to Kissflow in writing by courier is 1000 N West Street, Suite 1200, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801, USA with a CC tolegal@kissflow.comfor electronic mail. All notices shall be deemed to have been given immediately upon delivery by electronic mail, or if otherwise delivered upon receipt or, if earlier, two (2) business days after being deposited in the mail or with a courier as permitted above.13.7.

Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the Parties.13.9. Severability; No Waiver. If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. Kissflow’s non-exercise of any right under or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision of these Terms.13.10. Survival. All clauses shall survive any termination of Your Account. Termination shall not limit either Party’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms.
