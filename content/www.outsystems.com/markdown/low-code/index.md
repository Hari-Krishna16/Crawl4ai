## What is low-code?
**Low-code is a software development approach** that enables developers to create applications with minimal hand coding.
It introduces a user-friendly, [drag-and-drop development environment](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</application-development/drag-and-drop-app-builder/>) that makes app development accessible to both novice coders and experienced developers. A low-code approach allows for faster, more inclusive, and streamlined business software creation and innovation.
Because of its visual development capabilities and automation, **low-code enables developers to create complete applications** with modern user interfaces, [integrations](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</application-development/enterprise-application-guide/application-integration-eai-explained/>), data, and logic much faster than traditional development.
[Another term often associated with low-code is no-code](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</application-development/no-code/>), which uses visual development but requires no programming skills to build apps. Let’s understand the key differences.
## Low-code vs. no-code
Both low-code and no-code are development approaches that use visual programming and automation to create software solutions, rather than manual hand coding. However, they are not the same thing.
Essentially, five characteristics differentiate low-code development and no-code:
  * Technical expertise and target persona
  * Customization and flexibility
  * Development speed
  * Scalability
  * Use cases covered


**Low-code typically offers more flexibility and customization** options than no-code. The more advanced low-code platforms can even allow developers to extend capabilities provided by the platform with [pro-code](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</low-code/pro-code/>). They are also more scalable and address more complex, enterprise-grade use cases, as they can accommodate more complex app requirements and handle larger volumes of data.
On the other hand, no-code platforms, provide an even more simplified interface and are designed to be accessible to users with no technical background, also known as [citizen developers](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</application-development/no-code/what-is-citizen-developer/>). Unlike low-code, no-code is less flexible and has limited customization capabilities. They’re also less scalable, making them more suitable for simple, department-level applications.
## What’s the difference between low-code vs. traditional code?
The following comparison table highlights the key differences between traditional development and low-code:
Low-code | Traditional code  
---|---  
Development speed |  Significantly faster due to visual development tools and pre-configured components. |  Slower due to the need for extensive hand-coding and testing.  
Accessibility |  Accessible to a wider range of users, including business analysts and citizen developers. |  Requires specialized coding skills, making it less accessible to non-developers.  
Flexibility |  Allows for some custom coding to enhance and extend functionality. |  Offers maximum flexibility and control over the application’s functionality.  
Collaboration |  Promotes collaboration across departments by making development more intuitive. |  It can be more challenging to collaborate across departments due to technical complexity.  
Maintenance |  Easier to maintain and update applications due to visual nature and modular components. |  More complex and time-consuming to maintain and update applications.  
## When to use low-code?
Businesses crave adaptable solutions in a digital world that continues to evolve. Development teams are under a lot of pressure to respond to increasing customer expectations and to [accelerate digital transformation efforts](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/</blog/posts/digital-transformation-strategy/>)–and the demand to create new business solutions isn’t expected to slow down any time soon.
Low-code accelerates and removes the more tedious and complicated aspects of software development. Thus, it helps organizations overcome many of the hurdles of traditional development.
From a use cases perspective, the most **advanced low-code platforms can be used to create a variety of applications and use cases** such as pixel-perfect B2X mobile apps, web portals, employee experience apps, event-driven, and APIs that can be exposed to legacy systems, just to give a few examples.
Low-code platforms like OutSystems feature a visual development environment (IDE) for modeling business logic. They offer pre-built components, templates, and automatic integration capabilities for smooth app development, and have many benefits for your business.
Some of these benefits include:
  * Increased agility
  * Maximized productivity
  * Improved customer and employee experience
  * Increased collaboration between business and IT teams
  * Higher retention of developers

## Low-code AI: Integrating artificial intelligence with low-code
The [integration of AI with a low-code platform](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/<https:/www.outsystems.com/ai/generative/gen-ai-low-code/>) brings further benefits by enhancing both productivity and innovation in the development process:
  * **Intelligent automation:** AI-driven automation tools can identify repetitive tasks and automate them, reducing manual effort and accelerating development.
  * **Predictive analytics:** Artificial intelligence provides [predictive insights](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code/<https:/www.outsystems.com/ai/predictive-modeling-types-and-examples/>) that help developers foresee potential issues and optimize app performance.
  * **Enhanced user experience:** AI algorithms can analyze user behavior and preferences, allowing for the creation of more personalized and user-friendly apps.
  * **Natural language processing:** NLP enables the platform to understand and interpret user requirements more accurately, streamlining the development process.
  * **Continuous improvement:** AI continually learns and adapts, providing ongoing improvements to development processes and application functionalities.
