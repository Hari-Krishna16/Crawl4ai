                            use these specific features or services on the Platform, then the only information we collect

                            (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can

                            (cellular and landline), educational qualification(s), Aadhaar number, PAN, social security and

                            they
                            were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect
                            information from the URLs through which you connected with our Platform. Collecting such

                            with
                            legal and regulatory requirements. As necessary under this Privacy Policy, our Service Providers

                            required to protect the information we provide them in a manner that is consistent with this
                            Privacy
                            Policy. Although we exercise care in selecting our Service Providers and require them to protect
                            information as mentioned above, they are independent third parties and we may not have control
                            on

                            attendance, progress and completion of a Program. As part of our management and processing of
                            the
                            Program, we will use certain Personally Identifiable Information to administer exams, projects,
                            and
                            other assessments for the Program. For example, as part of an exam, ZeroCode Academy may use
                            certain
                            information collected from you in order to verify your identity or to monitor your performance

                            communications with you. For example, ZeroCode Academy may make available to you chat room
                            services
                            that allow you to communicate with ZeroCode Academy’s staff members or your peers in the same

                            similar service providers) with other students and make you a member of such a group. These
                            groups
                            may be used to provide services in conjunction with the Programs, including, but not limited to,

                            consented to share with them. ZeroCode Academy and/or its associates shall have no liability in
