# Payment Terms and Refund Policy
Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by ZeroCode Academy, full payment for participation in a Program is required at the time of registration. In the case of Programs that include a trial window, such trial window shall be made available only after the full payment. During the trial window, upon a request by the student, and to the satisfaction ofZeroCode Academy, ZeroCode Academy may choose to refund the Program Fees paid, subject to deduction of such applicable charges as may be decided by ZeroCode Academy from time to time. Once the trial window is closed, there will be no refund allowed for any reason whatsoever.
It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling into a Program to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the suitability and relevance of, the Program elected. The enrolment into a Program is non-transferable.
To make payment for any Program or to purchase any services or products offered by ZeroCode Academy through the Platform, you must have internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up ("Payment Method"). ZeroCode Academy does not store any of your credit card information or such other information restricted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for processing payment and has partnered with payment gateways for the payment towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider, you agree to abide by the terms of such a payment provider. You agree that in case ZeroCode Academyâ€™s third-party payment provider stores any such information, ZeroCode Academy will not be responsible for such storage, and it will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to store such information. Any loss of such information or any loss incurred by you due to the usage of such information will be solely a loss incurred by you, and ZeroCode Academy is in no way liable for any such losses and is neither responsible to reimburse / make good such losses in any manner whatsoever. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the payments made through the Platform.
Failure to pay the applicable Program fee may result in withdrawal of your access to a Program. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or exchange rates. ZeroCode Academy does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide to us at the time of enrolment/purchase.
You may cancel your enrolment at any time. Each Program has specific refund terms which shall be applicable in case of refund on account of such cancellation requests. 
If you have subscribed for a free trial, the free trial period will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address, contact number or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, you may be ineligible for certain features of a product or service during your free trial period.
